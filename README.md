## Wake Up Harddisk

Prevent Hard Disk from going to Sleep and writes an empty text file every few minutes
to your external hard disk drive to keep it from going into auto-sleep mode.

An external hard disk drive or USB from is going to sleep on a Linux computer.
You do not want your external hard disk going to sleep,
and yet you find that at times it goes into Sleep mode.

Sleep is a power-saving state that lets you quickly resume full-power operation when you want to start working again.

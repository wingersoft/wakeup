## Wake Up Harddisk

Prevent Hard Disk from going to Sleep. Wakeup writes an empty text file every few minutes
to your external hard disk drive to keep it from going into auto-sleep mode.

Sleep is a power-saving state that lets you quickly resume full-power operation when you want to start working again.
